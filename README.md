# BERTSummarizer
|| Final Project for Intermediate Python ||

In this project, I aim to employ a pre-trained BERT summarizer model to extract and produce summaries for any wikipedia page or raw text input. My goal is to pin BERT vs the "stock" wikipedia API summarizer and evaljuate the performance of each.

This project's application framework will be constructed and hosted by Streamlit
