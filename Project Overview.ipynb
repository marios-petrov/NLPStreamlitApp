    ">Coding and training your own summarizer, or executing your own text processing on a dataset is incredibly time-consuming and tedious. With my application, NLP functions that previously required a substantial time investment to carry out can now be done at the press of a button. All thanks to the incredibly easy-to-use interface constructed using the Streamlit library.\n",
